# Customer Information GUI

This repository contains a simple Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for collecting customer information and storing it in a local database.

### Files

* `FP5main.py`: The main script that runs the GUI. This is where customers will enter their data.
* `readData.py`: A utility script to view the data stored in the `customer.db` file directly from your terminal.
* `customer.db`: The SQLite database file where all customer information is saved.

### How to Use

#### 1. Running the GUI

To start the application and enter customer data, simply run the main script from your terminal:

```bash
python FP5main.py
